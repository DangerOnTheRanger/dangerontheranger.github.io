Schego is a work-in-progress R7RS Scheme VM written in Go. It will eventually include an x86 JIT and a full implementation of [STM (Software Transactional Memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory); Schego will likely be the first Scheme implementation in the world to implement STM. Additionally, as I write Schego, I post about it over on my blog, detailing the basics of things like lexing and parsing, as well as explaining and defending the implementation choices I made along the way.
